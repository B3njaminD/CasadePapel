The objective, to take control of the National Mint and Stamp Factory in order to print 2.4 billion euros in small denominations of 50 â‚¬ and this in less than eleven days, without shedding a single drop of blood - despite the presence of 67 hostages, including the daughter of the British ambassador. But plans, even the best ones, never go as planned. The robber team will face many challenges as Raquel Murillo, the police chief, tries to stop them.</div>

			 <div class="text">The biggest robbery in history is threatened. The Professor's plans are mistreated when the police discover the hideout where he orchestrated the junkyard with his team. Nothing is going right between Berlin, Tokyo, Denver and the rest of the group, where internal quarrels threaten to separate them. Tired and at the end of their nerves, the situation became more complicated within the National Currency and Stamp Factory as Berlin regained control of the operation. For his part, Raquel continues his investigation, tightening the noose around the true identity of the operation's brain. Will the Professor and his team manage to get out of the bank with all the money without losing anyone?</div>

			 <div class="text">After fleeing the National Mint and Stamp Factory, the Professor receives a call: one of the members of the gang has been captured! The only way to help him while protecting others is to bring them together to make a new robbery, the biggest breakage ever imagined. But again, the plan will not go as planned: this time it is the plan of the professor and not that of his father. Lots of twists and turns in this season 3: will characters end up in the hands of the police? "It is no longer a theft but to destroy the system: We are at War". Here are the Professor's last words at the end of the season, which is enough to announce a season 4 full of action.</div>
